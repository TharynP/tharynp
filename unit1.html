    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>The world of cheeseburger consumption can be a confusing and scary place, especially for newcomers trying to get their foot in the door. This comprehensive guide will teach you many essential skills for eating cheeseburgers, such as hand placement, essential tableware, the process of taking a bite, and much more.</p>
    <h3>But first, what even IS a cheeseburger?</h3>
    <p>A cheeseburger is a hot sandwich comprised of three essential ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Buns</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Beef Patty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While the flavors and even composition of these ingredients may vary, such as using swiss cheese instead of the more common american or cheddar cheese, a cheeseburger must always have these three ingredients. To learn more about the history of the cheeseburger and even how to make one, please look out for our next online guide, "What's In These Buns?." (Note: This course does not cover <b>hamburgers</b>, as they are a very different branch of the burger family, and require various changes in environment, behavior, and attitude.)</p>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>To begin the process of consuming a cheeseburger, you must first be aware of your surroundings. Ask yourself, "Am I in a suitable environment? Do I have all the materials I need? Am I putting myself or a loved one at risk by consuming this cheeseburger?" Once you have accurately and properly examined your situation, you must ensure all materials, tools, and tableware needed are in their proper places and are ready to be used. There are no required tableware, but some popular items to aid the process of consuming a cheeseburger are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Plate</li>
      <li>Fork</li>
      <li>Napkin</li>
      <li>Camera</li>
      <li>Emergency Stretcher</li>
      <li>Loaded Firearm</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After you have gathered all materials and prepared them for their intended use, you are ready to begin consumption.</p>
    <h3>Consuming the cheeseburger</h3>
    <p>The actual process of eating your cheeseburger can become second nature to you with enough practice, so you will not need to follow these steps as precisely once you have mastered this skill. That being said, it is highly recommended you follow every step in order, and to completion.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>To begin the process, face your cheeseburger so that it is directly in front of you. Make sure there are no objects or people obstructing your path to the cheeseburger.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Move your fingers close to each other, with the exception of your thumb, then place them on the top bun of the cheeseburger, with your thumbs holding the bottom bun, so that the cheeseburger is now in your grasp, and that the contents of your cheeseburger are in your clear view.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Bring the cheeseburger close to your mouth. This may stress some beginners out, as having a cheeseburger in close proximtiy of their face is a new and exciting experience. Don't worry, you're in <i>no</i> immediate danger. It is very unlikely that consuming the cheeseburger will be detrimental to your health, however if you experience any unpleasant feelings or changes, it is recommended you consult your doctor.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Once you have brought the cheeseburger to your mouth, open your mouth and place as much of the cheeseburger as you can comfortably fit inside your mouth. It is <b>very important</b> that you do not let go of the cheeseburger once part of it is inside your mouth.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Forcefully close your mouth so that a chunk of the cheeseburger is torn off and is separated from the rest of the cheeseburger. This is called "biting."</li>
      <br>
      <li>Repeatedly open and close your jaw, while keeping your lips together. This process is called "chewing," and crushes the cheeseburger into a substance suitable for digestion. After chewing, swallow the crushed cheeseburger substance.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Repeat steps 4 through 6 as you bite off more of the burger. Eventually, you will have bitten off enough that the remaining portion can fit in your mouth, and you will not have to keep holding it. After you have eaten all of the cheeseburger, it is important you clean up and ensure all equipment is cleaned and returned properly.
      <br>
    </ol>
    <h3>So, what now?</h3>
    <p>Now that you've successfully eaten the cheeseburger, you should reflect on the steps you've taken, and how you can better yourself as an expert cheeseburger eater. As long as you practice these steps in order whenever you begin eating a cheeseburger, you'll learn this valuable skill in no time.</p>
